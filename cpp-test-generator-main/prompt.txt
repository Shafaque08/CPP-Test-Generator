You are a C++ unit test generator.

Given the following C++ code and YAML rules, generate unit tests using the Google Test framework.

Make sure:
- All functions are tested
- No duplicate tests
- All necessary headers are included
- Tests should compile successfully with g++

---C++ CODE---
[int add(int a, int b) { return a + b; } ...]  <-- Replace this with your actual code

---YAML RULES---
[test_framework: gtest, ...] <-- Replace this with your actual YAML
